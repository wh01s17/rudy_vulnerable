    <h1>R.U.D.Y. Vulnerable Django Application</h1>
    <p>This application is intentionally vulnerable to R.U.D.Y. attacks for educational purposes.</p>
    
    <h2>Vulnerable Endpoints:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/form/">Form Submission Endpoint</a> - Vulnerable to slow POST attacks</li>
        <li><a href="/upload/">File Upload Endpoint</a> - Vulnerable to large file uploads</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>About R.U.D.Y. Attacks:</h2>
    <p>R.U.D.Y. (R-U-Dead-Yet) is a DoS attack that works by opening connections to a targeted server and then keeping those connections open for as long as possible by slowly sending data through them. This causes server resources to be consumed and eventually exhausts all connection pools, making the server unavailable to legitimate users.</p>
    
    <h2>Educational Purposes Only:</h2>
    <p>This application is meant for educational demonstrations of how R.U.D.Y. attacks work and how to defend against them. Please only use in controlled environments with proper authorization.</p>
